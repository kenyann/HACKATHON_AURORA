10. Proposal: Develop an AI solution utilizing video surveillance data
 for in-depth analysis of customer behavior.
1.INTRO:
Introduction to the importance of understanding 
customer behavior in retail environments. Challenges and inefficiencies faced by retail businesses.
Suboptimal store layout due to a lack of understanding of customer navigation.
Ineffective marketing strategies without detailed customer insights.
Decreased customer satisfaction due to a lack of understanding of needs and
preferences.
2.  PROBLEM STATEMENT
DEFINING THE PROBLEM
Core issue addressed by the MVP: Lack of real-time, 
Traditional data collection methods are limited in scope 
       detailed information on customer behavior in retail environments.
       and fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer interactions.

Mention of companies utilizing
video data for monitoring
customer movements.
Highlight the limitations of
existing solutions, primarily
focusing on aggregated data
rather than detailed action
identification
MVP differentiates itself by
focusing on detailed action
recognition and providing
actionable insights based on
customer behavior models.
Aim to enable businesses to
make informed decisions on store
layout, product placement, and
marketing strategies.
Emphasis on improving customer
satisfaction and increasing sales. 3. Solution Overview.
Data preprocessing: Remove noise and enhance video
quality.
Action recognition model: A deep trained network to classify
actions.
Action tracking: Track customers' actions and movements
during shopping.
Our proposed AI solution is to develop an action recognition
model to classify and track customer behavior.
Machine learning and computer vision techniques will be used to
analyze the images. What's new in the
solution we offer?
Existing customer behavior analysis
solutions only use sales data by month,
quarter, etc. This is quite inadequate
because it may not be optimal and does not
accurately reflect real behavior. customer's
health. We use AI tools and algorithms to
analyze based on provided image and video
data. The solution provides a more
comprehensive and detailed behavioral
analysis result. Specifically, the AI solution willinclude improvements such as:
Detailed action recognition: Solution to
identify and classify many customer actions.
Real-time insights: The solution can analyze
and provide insights from video data in real-
time, allowing businesses to make immediate
adjustments to their operations based on on
customer behavior.
Actionable Insights: The solution provides
insights that can be used to optimize store
layout, product placement and marketing
strategy. 4. Methodologies
AI MODEL ARCHITECTURE.
The action recognition model is a deep convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture. CNN extracts
features from video frames and these features are then
used to classify customer actions.
MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE MODEL.
Convolution layer (input): This layer will receive
video data from surveillance cameras.
Pooling (processing) layers: This layer will use
machine learning techniques to analyze video data
and extract features of customer behavior.
Fully connected layer (classification): This layer
will use classification techniques to classify
behavioral features into specific behaviors.

The MVP will be able to identify and categorize the following fivecustomer actions: Action Insights :
Be able to identify what factors make customers more interested and engaged.
Adjust your store layout to optimize the shopping experience and enhance product
appeal.
Placing products in strategic locations in the store increases the chances that
customers will interact with the product and even increases sales, advertise and
promote products or areas that customers frequently visit.
MVPs will provide actionable insights based on customer behavior patterns : 6. MVPs will be evaluated based on
performance metrics
Action recognition accuracy: The accuracy of the action recognition model will bemeasured as the percentage of correctly classified frames. Accuracy of action tracking: The accuracy of the
action tracking component will be measured in
the percentage of correctly tracked frames.
Relevance of action insights: will be measured
by how useful they are in optimizing store
layouts,product placement and marketing
strategy.

7. Timeline and Roadmap
THE MVP IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN SIX MONTHS. HERE ARE THE
RECOMMENDED TIMINGS AND ROADMAP: Model Development: Building on the
knowledge gained from research, this
stage focuses on developing the action
recognition model. Decisions
regarding the model's structure,
algorithms, and key parameters will be
made during this phase.
Research: In this phase, the team will
dedicate time to conduct extensive
research on action recognition methods,
available machine learning models, and
modern standards in this field. The goal
is to identify the most suitable strategy
and technology for the project.
Stage 1:
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACTION RECOGNITION MODELS(MONTH1-3) Model Training: With the collected
data, the team will initiate the model
training process. Techniques for fine-
tuning the model and optimizing
performance will be applied during this
stage to ensure the model operates
accurately and efficiently.
Data Collection: In this stage, the
team will concentrate on gathering the
necessary data for training and testing
the model. This data will include
images or videos of the actions that
the model needs to recognize.
Stage 2:
DATA COLLECTION AND TRAINING OF ACTION RECOGNITION MODEL(MONTH 4-5) Testing and Adjustment: Following
deployment, the team will conduct
testing to ensure that the MVP
functions correctly in real-world
conditions. Final adjustments may be
implemented to improve performance
and address any issues that arise
during the deployment process.
Deployment: The final stage of the
project is the deployment of the
Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This
may involve integrating the model into
a real-world environment, connecting
with other systems if necessary, and
preparing for the collection of real-
world data.
Stage 3:
DEPLOYMENT OF MVP(MONTH 6) Customizable Reporting:
Enables users to create and customize reports based on their
specific needs. This may include selecting specific charts,
combining data from various sources, and choosing key metrics.
Real-Time Interaction:
 Allows users to track behavior and analyze data instantly,
enabling them to make decisions promptly. This can be achieved
through continuous updates on the user interface or through push
notifications.
Cloud Interface:
Stores data in the cloud, providing users with access to
information from anywhere they need. This creates flexibility and
convenience in managing and monitoring customer behavior.
