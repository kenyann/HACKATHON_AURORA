Team’s code: 110 Introduction
The current issue for fashion brands is enhancing the user experience in 
finding their preferred products.
SneakerBot assists customers in easily discovering desired products by 
providing necessary information.
Our MVP focuses on the dataset "Dataset 1: Adidas and Nike Products" 
and collects additional necessary information to train the model.
2 Nowadays, major fashion brands like Nike and Adidas 
are introducing more and more new products to keep 
up with market trends. Customers often spend a lot of 
time selecting fashion items in stores. While shops 
provide search engine on their websites, the sheer 
variety of products makes it time-consuming for 
customers to find what they need.
The MVP focuses on improving the 
search for preferred products and 
enhancing user experience by providing 
a chatbot consultant
Problem Statement
3 Solution Overview - Multimodal RAG
4 Methodologies
First of all, we are utilizing OpenAI Vision to apply the technique of Grounded 
Language Image Pretrained (GLIP) in order to make the core connection of user 
query with any image of products in database. To convert images into captions or 
hashtags for future search.
5 Methodologies
With the storage, we using Vector Storage, in which, all the texts would be encoded 
into vectors and stored as points in Dimension. Similarity Search would detect out 
which points is nearest and identify it as most similar.
 6 Methodologies
Finally, we using technical Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting to improve the 
performance of chatbot, in which, it has to thought carefully before generate out 
final answer for user. In top of that, we introduce Reason-Action (ReAct) Agent, 
which is an innovation of CoT for the final version of chatbot.
 7 Core Functionality
The primary features and functionalities of the MVP:
● Efficient data exploration

9 Timeline 
Research Idea
Chatbot Product Consultant: E-commerce 
platforms are increasingly adopting 
chatbots to enhance customer support, 
provide personalized recommendations, 
and improve the overall shopping 
experience.
Data Processing
Using the provided dataset, we perform 
preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, 
normalization, and feature engineering. 
Additionally, we augment the dataset by 
incorporating additional relevant data to 
enhance the quality and diversity of the input
Evaluate Solution
Based on the test results, we iteratively 
refine and enhance the solution, 
incorporating improvements to address 
any identified issues and create a more 
robust and effective solution.
Research Method
Retrieval Augmented Generation 
(RAG) is a pattern that works with 
pre trained Large Language Models 
(LLM) and your own data to 
generate responses.
Solution Experiment
After finalizing the solution improvements, 
we proceed to deploy it using the processed 
dataset, ensuring that the solution is ready 
for real-world usage and delivering the 
desired outcomes.

This is a sample query of customer, where user found an attracted image of Hoodie, and 
he wants to ﬁnd relevant sample with an economical price. And the chatbot give out 
directly the recommendation of product for user and its website. 12 Limitations and Future Enhancements
The limitation of vector search is the accuracy of object relationship.
The future work is to replace the vector search with graph search that brings the 
better result.
